# Review Lifecycle Architecture

## Purpose and status

This document defines the target product architecture for Review identity,
revision history, freshness, result presentation, and re-review. It is an
adopted design direction, not a claim that every contract described here is
already implemented.

The current execution baseline remains in
[deep-review.md](deep-review.md): Review resolves bounded target evidence and
runs an isolated read-only `CodeReview` or `DeepReview` child. Today, one run is
still represented primarily by that child session. This design adds a stable
user-facing layer above those executions; it does not replace their runtime,
target-evidence, or safety owners.

The product outcome is simple:

- one explicit review lineage is one **Review record**;
- each initial run or user-requested re-review is one **revision** of that
  record;
- child sessions, workers, and quality checks remain execution details;
- Review starts in the background and leaves a durable result surface in the
  parent task;
- the latest revision is primary, while older revisions remain inspectable;
- no AI conclusion is presented as a gate result or as proof that a change is
  safe to merge.

## Architecture overview

```

The Review record is the durable product identity. An execution child is a
replaceable implementation mechanism for one revision. The bounded projection
allows list and card restoration without loading a full transcript; the full
structured report remains the source of detailed findings.

This separation follows three ownership rules:

1. **Product identity stays stable.** A new child does not create a second
   user-facing Review when the user is explicitly reviewing the same lineage
   again.
2. **Execution remains isolated.** Read-only reviewer sessions preserve
   independent context and cannot edit the target while reviewing it.
3. **Evidence remains authoritative.** The record describes a run; it never
   widens, replaces, or guesses the prepared target evidence owned by the
   existing Review launch path.

### Review record

A record represents one explicit review lineage. The first Review child is its
persisted anchor and creates the stable record identity. Later revisions point
back to that anchor. The identity is reused only when the user selects a
re-review action for the record, including a post-fix review. Two independent
launches must not be merged merely because their file lists or pull-request
revisions look similar.

The record carries only facts shared by the lineage, including sparse
user-owned finding dispositions. Target identity, Review strength, and model
conclusions belong to individual revisions, so an explicit stronger re-review
does not require a second record.

### Review revision

Each revision has an immutable identity, trigger, Review strength, start time,
and optional predecessor. It points to the existing prepared target evidence
rather than copying the diff or repository contents. A revision may persist a
bounded outcome projection containing only what list and card views require,
such as:

- result availability and completion time;
- coverage (`complete`, `limited`, `failed`, or `unknown`) and target freshness
  (`current`, `stale`, or `unknown`) as separate facts;
- finding count and risk level;
- model recommendation and a short assessment;
- cross-revision observation counts when available.

Issue bodies, full diffs, model messages, and tool transcripts do not belong in
the projection. Keeping the projection bounded prevents session metadata from
becoming a second report store.

### Lifecycle and outcome projection

Execution phase, result availability, finding conclusion, evidence coverage,
and target freshness are independent facts. They must not be collapsed into one
state enum: a stale Review may still contain important findings, and a Review
with limited coverage may still need immediate attention.

First compose the independent facts:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Revision["Review revision"] --> Phase["Phase"]
    Revision --> Availability["Availability"]
    Revision --> Findings["Findings"]
    Revision --> Coverage["Coverage"]
    Revision --> Freshness["Freshness"]
    Phase --> View["Review presentation"]
    Availability --> View
    Findings --> View
    Coverage --> View
    Freshness --> View
```

Then project the same Review into product surfaces:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    View["Review presentation"] --> Parent["Parent task"]
    View --> PR["Pull request"]
    View -. "optional" .-> Detail["Execution detail"]
```

Only execution phase is a lifecycle state machine:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Preparing
    Preparing --> Preparing: recover same idempotent request
    Preparing --> Running: execution accepted
    Preparing --> Failed: launch failed definitively
    Running --> Completed
    Running --> Failed
    Running --> Cancelled
    Completed --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

The preparing self-loop may repair session creation or delivery acknowledgement
for the same idempotent request; it must not submit a second logical reviewer
turn. Once a revision has started or reached a terminal phase, explicit Retry,
Review again, post-fix Review, or Review current version creates a new immutable
revision. Target staleness never rewrites the prior revision's execution phase.

The UI composes the dimensions instead of choosing one winner. Examples include
“Needs attention · limited coverage”, “No actionable findings · current target”,
and “Needs attention · stale target”. `stale` is reserved for target-version
mismatch; `limited` describes coverage of the target that was actually reviewed.

A lossless source contract is required before this projection ships. The
current single `evidence_status` value cannot be the only source because a stale
target may also have limited coverage. Structured Review output must preserve
independent `coverage` and `freshness` fields, or equivalent machine-readable
reason codes from which both can be derived without precedence-based
overwriting. The derivation rules are:

- workspace freshness compares the prepared workspace fingerprint with the
  current fingerprint; mismatch is stale and unavailable comparison is unknown;
- an explicit Git range resolved to immutable object ids is current for that
  selected range unless its objects or binding can no longer be validated;
- pull-request freshness requires a refreshed exact provider identity and
  base/head comparison; mismatch is stale and failed refresh is unknown;
- coverage is computed from prepared diff completeness, omissions, unavailable
  content, and execution coverage, and is never rewritten merely because
  freshness changed.

“No findings” must include coverage and freshness and must not be rendered as
“passed”, “approved”, or “safe to merge”. A model recommendation remains advice,
not a repository gate result.

## Finding continuity

Finding continuity has two independent dimensions:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Compare["Compare current and previous structured reports"] --> Observation["System observation<br/>new · repeated · changed · not observed"]
    User["Explicit user action"] --> Disposition["User disposition<br/>open · resolved · dismissed"]
    Observation --> Finding["Finding shown in current Review"]
    Disposition --> Finding
```

- **Observation** describes what the current reviewer reported relative to the
  prior revision.
- **Disposition** records an explicit user decision and is never inferred from
  model silence.
- A finding that is absent from a sufficiently covered later report becomes
  `not observed`, not automatically `resolved`.
- A stable **group key** based on normalized path, category, and title keeps
  related findings together across revisions.
- A separate **occurrence fingerprint** covers the normalized evidence that may
  change the finding's meaning, including location, severity, certainty,
  description, and validation evidence when present.
- Disposition carries forward only when both the group key and occurrence
  fingerprint match exactly. The same group with changed evidence is surfaced
  as `changed` and returns to open attention.
- Similar text is not enough to claim semantic identity. Fuzzy or model-based
  matching may support future suggestions, but it must not close findings.

Both keys use versioned deterministic normalization. The group key is a
continuity aid, while the occurrence fingerprint protects user decisions from
being applied to materially different evidence. Neither key proves that two
natural-language descriptions are semantically identical.

## Execution and re-review boundaries

Review strength remains controlled by explicit intent. Ordinary Review keeps
ordinary strength. The current implementation uses one `CodeReview` child for
bounded targets, while a large or provider-limited target may use bounded
managed packets without becoming a different user-facing mode. The primary
reviewer may request zero to two focused checks for concrete unresolved questions;
Strict Review may spend up to three spawned calls shared with a conditional
quality check. This behavior does not change Review strength, expose fixed
architecture, frontend, performance, product, or security agents as required
user choices, or turn every available capability into a model call.

Starting Review creates the durable revision before sending the first reviewer
turn. It leaves the user in the parent task by default. Opening execution detail
is explicit, and an empty or metadata-only child must show preparing, loading,
or load-failed state instead of a blank pane.

Every re-review refreshes target evidence before execution:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["Review again"] --> Source{"Target source"}
    Source -->|Known local fix scope| Exact{"Can mutations be attributed exactly?"}
    Exact -->|Yes| Scoped["Scoped re-review<br/>original scope plus changed files"]
    Exact -->|No| Workspace["Full current-workspace fallback<br/>label scope honestly"]
    Source -->|Pull request| Refresh["Revalidate provider identity and base/head"]
    Refresh --> CurrentPr["Review the complete current PR target"]
    Source -->|Other explicit target| Resolve["Resolve a fresh bounded target"]

    Scoped --> Revision["Create next revision in the same record"]
    Workspace --> Revision
    CurrentPr --> Revision
    Resolve --> Revision
```

Pull-request providers currently guarantee the current pull-request base/head
target, not an arbitrary previous-head-to-current-head delta across all
supported platforms. A PR re-review therefore reviews the complete refreshed
target and compares structured results by revision. It must not be marketed as
a token-saving delta review unless a future provider-neutral delta contract can
prove that scope.

Existing diff-page suppression and file-read receipts remain the evidence-read
optimization owners. The Review record must not add another content cache or a
second interpretation of which bytes were reviewed.

## Product projection

The same record is projected into two existing product surfaces:

| Surface | Primary content | Secondary detail |
|---|---|---|
| Parent task | target, latest revision, freshness, coverage, findings, next action | open the structured Review result or execution detail |
| Pull-request panel | latest matching record for verified provider identity and base/head | older revisions and stale-result history |

Starting a Review does not force-open an internal child pane. The Review card is
available immediately and remains useful after restart; raw execution messages
are diagnostic detail, not the product result. Detail shows plain-language
questions and real states without Skill names, agent ids, packet ids, or budgets.
A child with no loaded transcript renders preparing, loading, or load-failed
state rather than a title over an empty body.

Focused-check titles cross one narrow public boundary:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Assignment["Focused question"] --> Admission["Runtime admission"]
    Admission --> Label["Public label"]
    Label --> Card["Card"]
    Label --> Detail["Detail"]
    Assignment -. "internal fields" .-> Execution["Execution only"]
```

The label is short, plain-language metadata stored in the admitted child
manifest. Cards and detail tabs read only that label; they never derive titles
from the model prompt, capability key, path scope, or other launch arguments.
Missing or unsafe labels use a generic localized title and never block the
check. Linking projects only the admitted public label; the existing manifest
is persisted for recovery. Both representations come from the same admitted
assignment, without sending internal manifest fields through the UI event.
Session reconstruction re-admits that label through the same runtime function
before restored metadata is persisted.

### Execution detail and recovery projection

Execution outcome and transcript availability are separate facts. A Review can
still be running while history loading fails, and a completed Review can be
visible before its transcript is hydrated. Card and detail surfaces therefore
derive one presentation from existing session and Task facts instead of keeping
a second UI-owned lifecycle.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Metadata["Session metadata"] --> Content["Content state"]
    Live["Live session"] --> Status["Execution state"]
    Turn["Last turn"] --> Status
    Task["Task result"] --> Status
    Content --> View["Review view"]
    Status --> View
    View --> Card["Card"]
    View --> Detail["Detail"]
    View --> Actions["Actions"]
```

Content state has four user-visible outcomes:

| Source fact | Detail body |
|---|---|
| new child with no turn yet | preparing |
| metadata only, or history hydration in progress | loading |
| hydrated transcript | transcript and result |
| history hydration failed | load failed with a load-only retry |

Reloading content never starts or continues model execution. A load failure is
not presented as a Review failure, and an empty transcript is never rendered as
an unexplained blank pane.

Execution state is derived in this order:

1. A live `Processing` session is running. Live state wins over the persisted
   idle form while a runtime still owns the turn.
2. A structured Task result such as `partial_timeout` or `cancelled` preserves
   the more precise parent-visible outcome. This matters because a child with
   partial output may have a completed persisted turn even though the bounded
   reviewer execution timed out.
3. The latest child turn supplies completed, error, or cancelled state.
4. A restored idle session with an unfinished latest turn is interrupted; it is
   not running and is not complete.
5. Parent Task status is a compatibility fallback only when the linked child or
   its persisted facts are unavailable.

These are projection rules, not a new persisted enum or a second state machine.
They produce the following plain-language behavior:

| Execution outcome | Presentation | Allowed action |
|---|---|---|
| active turn | running | stop |
| completed turn | completed | inspect result |
| timeout with output | timed out, partial result kept | inspect partial result |
| timeout without output | timed out | return to the owning Review |
| model or provider failure | could not complete | return to the owning Review |
| user-confirmed cancellation | stopped | inspect retained output |
| runtime lost with an unfinished turn | interrupted | return to the owning Review; continue there when available |
| incomplete legacy facts | unable to confirm | reload details; do not retry automatically |

An individual focused check never exposes a direct rerun action. The owning
Review remains responsible for bounded retries and coverage decisions, so the
UI cannot bypass its retry budget or duplicate work. Continuation is available
only for an interrupted, nonterminal Review at the Review-session level. It
reuses that session and appends a turn without creating a second logical launch.
Retry after a terminal timeout or failure remains an explicit new revision.
Opening details, restoring a window, or restarting the application must not
resubmit the original request.

Stopping has a confirmation boundary:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Running
    Running --> Stopping: user stops
    Stopping --> Stopped: cancellation confirmed
    Stopping --> Running: cancellation not confirmed
```

`Stopping` is transient UI intent. The UI settles the turn as stopped only after
the runtime accepts cancellation. If cancellation cannot be confirmed, it
reloads the authoritative state and says that stopping could not be confirmed;
it must not claim success or launch replacement work.

Application restore follows runtime ownership rather than the last visible card:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Restore["Restore"] --> LiveOwner{"Runtime active?"}
    LiveOwner -->|Yes| Running["Running"]
    LiveOwner -->|No| LastTurn{"Turn finished?"}
    LastTurn -->|Yes| Terminal["Saved outcome"]
    LastTurn -->|No| Interrupted["Interrupted"]
    LastTurn -->|Unknown| Unknown["Unable to confirm"]
```

Persisted processing state is not revived after an application restart. If a
remote or still-running host remains authoritative, its live state is shown;
otherwise an unfinished turn is interrupted and waits for explicit user intent.
Partial transcript content remains inspectable in either case.

The pull-request surface continues to use exact provider identity and verified
base/head freshness. A stale record offers “Review current version” and creates
another revision of that record. Cached pull-request overview data is not
sufficient to mark a Review current.

## Persistence, recovery, and compatibility

The existing session-history persistence service is the only storage and query
owner for Review records. It stores a small record anchor on the first Review
child and revision metadata on every Review child; no parallel Review database
or UI-owned index is introduced.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph History["Session-history persistence owner"]
        Anchor["Record anchor metadata<br/>record identity · version · sparse dispositions"]
        Revisions["Revision metadata<br/>target reference · phase · bounded outcome"]
        Query["Bounded Review summary query"]
        Anchor --> Query
        Revisions --> Query
    end

    Query --> Parent["Parent task Review card"]
    Query --> PullRequest["Pull-request Review surface"]
    Parent -->|"open details"| Transcript["Hydrated Review transcript"]
    PullRequest -->|"open details"| Transcript
```

- The record anchor owns stable lineage identity and sparse explicit finding
  dispositions. Record mutations go through one record-metadata service,
  serialize writes per record, and reject stale updates with a monotonic record
  version.
- Revision metadata owns immutable revision identity, target reference,
  execution phase, and the bounded outcome projection. It does not own
  record-level user decisions.
- Parent-task lookup queries persisted Review summaries by parent relationship.
  Pull-request lookup queries by exact provider/repository/pull-request identity
  and verified base/head. Neither surface may infer the latest record by scanning
  only the sessions currently loaded in UI memory.
- The query is a bounded projection over existing session metadata, not another
  persistence store. Full reports and issue bodies are hydrated only when the
  user opens details.
- Archive, retention, and deletion operate on the record as one ownership
  group. The product does not expose permanent deletion of an anchor or
  individual revision while sibling revisions remain. Deleting a Review removes
  its anchor and revisions through the session-history owner; remote sync and
  cleanup use the same record-level operation.
- If external corruption or legacy cleanup leaves revisions without their
  anchor, the query returns a read-only `history incomplete` record. It does not
  reconstruct missing dispositions or silently choose a new anchor; Review
  again starts a new record, while whole-record deletion remains available.
- The full structured report remains recoverable from the Review transcript;
  projection write failure must not destroy the report.
- A metadata-only restore can render target, lifecycle, and bounded outcome
  before transcript hydration. Opening details then hydrates the child.
- Idempotent launch retry reuses the same immutable revision identity. An
  uncertain launch acknowledgement must not silently submit a second reviewer
  turn.
- Existing Review sessions without record metadata are projected as one legacy
  record using their child identity. No bulk migration or parallel persistence
  store is required.
- User finding dispositions are sparse and keyed by exact group key plus
  occurrence fingerprint. Default-open observations and full issue bodies are
  not duplicated into metadata.

## Quality and governance

This architecture does not require a Review-specific telemetry pipeline. The
Quality Data Plane remains the future shared owner for registered product
events; creating separate Review logs, analytics storage, or a dashboard would
split governance without improving correctness.

The design must instead be protected first by deterministic acceptance
evidence:

- launch does not force-open execution detail;
- no Review state renders as an unexplained blank pane;
- execution status and transcript-loading status remain independent;
- opening or reloading detail performs no model call and creates no child turn;
- a partial timeout keeps partial output and remains visibly distinct from a
  successful completion;
- user cancellation is shown as stopped only after cancellation is confirmed;
- application restart never silently revives or duplicates an unfinished turn;
- an interrupted Review can continue only through explicit Review-level intent;
- an individual focused check cannot bypass the owning Review's retry policy;
- metadata-only restore shows a useful bounded summary;
- stale pull-request revisions cannot be presented as current;
- re-review preserves one record and creates a distinct revision;
- model silence never resolves a finding;
- record projection adds no model call and no duplicate content read;
- Review remains read-only, and remediation still requires the separate
  user-approved fixer path.
- a single-domain ordinary Review does not launch a focused check merely because
  matching capabilities are installed;
- focused checks cannot read changed files outside their assigned scope;
- remote Review does not expose a focused-check action until the same scope
  guarantees are available through remote file access;
- large-target file packets and review capabilities do not create multiplicative
  fan-out;
- findings are deduplicated by changed location and root cause instead of being
  grouped by reviewer;
- existing runtime logs support offline token, returned-character, round, and
  wall-time comparison without a Review-specific telemetry store.

If the shared Quality Data Plane gains a production producer, Review may emit
only registered lifecycle and explicit feedback facts with defined retention,
privacy, ownership, and denominator rules. Instrumentation is not an excuse to
introduce another Review runtime or persistence owner.

## Non-goals

- Automatic Review on every save, push, or pull-request update.
- Automatic comment publishing, approval, merge, or gate enforcement.
- A generic workflow or agent-orchestration framework.
- A user-visible roster of fixed specialist agents.
- Launching one full-diff reviewer for every available built-in, Skill, or user
  review capability.
- Fuzzy semantic finding closure or model-driven disposition changes.
- Reusing a local result for a pull request without exact repository, target,
  content, policy, and context equivalence.
- Pretending that every provider supports arbitrary revision-delta Review.
- A new telemetry store, analytics dashboard, or Review-only data plane.
