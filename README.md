## A New-Generation Foundation for Agentic Applications

BitFun puts the engineering capabilities of the Code Agent at its core and brings together Co-work and Claw (Assistant Agent) for coding, office work, and more real-world scenarios—creating a local-first, new-generation foundation for agentic applications, powered by a Rust-built Agent Runtime and a polished desktop app experience.

- **Lights-Out Factory** (In Progress): Design during the day, let tasks flow to the server and run through the night, then review the results in the morning.
- **Infinite Radius** (In Progress): Extending from desktop and browser to mobile, wearables, and more devices, so work stays accessible and continuous.
- **App Evolution**: Build tailored workflows with custom Agents, MCP, Skills, Mini Apps, or source-level customization. **Community contributors have already created specialized versions for short-form drama, media, and more**.
- **Better, Faster, Cheaper**: Pursue greater efficiency, better results, and lower cost.
- **Ultimate Desktop**: Continuously refine an easier-to-use, more capable, and more beautiful desktop experience.

## Agent Core Metrics

The data below evaluates BitFun's core Agent capabilities. All measurements use **Deepseek-V4-Pro** and are grouped into completion results, token economy, and other experience metrics.

> The current numbers are BitFun's initial evaluation results, with each case run once. Benchmarks can fluctuate with task sampling, model versions, runtime environment, and single-run variance, so these scores are meant as an initial sanity signal that the current Agent is already reasonably capable, not as a fixed ranking claim or final ceiling. We will keep optimizing and release full benchmark details later.

### 1. Completion Results

BitFun leads Open Code and Claude Code on both **SWE-Bench-Pro** and **SWE-Bench-Verified**. SWE-Bench-Pro focuses on complex software engineering, while SWE-Bench-Verified focuses on human-verified GitHub issue fixes.

Benchmark references: [SWE-Bench-Pro](https://labs.scale.com/leaderboard/swe_bench_pro_public) / [SWE-Bench-Verified](https://www.swebench.com/verified.html)

### 2. Token Economy

Agent economy needs to be evaluated across end-to-end token consumption, execution time, and KV Cache reuse. The current snapshot first covers KV Cache behavior from the same SWE-Bench-Pro round: BitFun's average KV Cache hit rate was **98.67%**. The follow-up full benchmark report will add the broader cost and latency metrics.

### 3. Other Experience Metrics

Beyond cost, Agent experience also depends on how quickly it can retrieve context in very large engineering projects. For tens-of-millions-line repositories such as Chromium, BitFun uses **flashgrep** to reduce search time by up to about **94.6%**, with an average speedup of about **36.1x**.

## Two Core Scenarios, One Extensible Agent Desktop

You can hand two kinds of complex work to BitFun: shipping code in real repositories and turning source material into office deliverables. When a task needs the browser, desktop apps, the terminal, or a remote environment, it can enter the real workspace; when your workflow needs more, you can extend it with custom Agents, MCP, Skills, and Mini Apps.

### Core Scenarios

| Scenario | Delivery goal | Typical capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coding** | Move from a real repository to a mergeable result. | Agentic, Plan, Debug, testing, Git, Deep Review, long-horizon tasks, and benchmarks. |
| **Office Work** | Move from source material to deliverable documents. | Research, PPT, DOCX, XLSX, PDF, summarization, writing, meeting notes, and reports. |

### Shared Capabilities

- **Desktop execution layer**: Computer Use, browser operation, desktop apps, the filesystem, terminals, remote workspaces, and Mini Apps let the Agent enter real work environments.
- **Customization layer**: MCP, Skills, custom Agents, Mini Apps, and source-level extension let BitFun keep growing around your tools, roles, and interfaces.

## Ready Out of the Box

### Download directly

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GCWing/BitFun/releases) to download the latest desktop installer. After installation, configure your model and start using BitFun.

### Run from source

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.12+ (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10.15.0 via Corepack
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run desktop:dev
```

For more development details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Customize Your BitFun

BitFun's extension paths progress continuously from light to deep customization:

| Tier | Path | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** | Custom Agent | Defining roles, flows, constraints, and tool bundles. |
| **L2** | MCP / Skills / [Hooks](docs/features/agent-hooks.md) | Connecting external tools and professional capabilities, and running your own commands at Agent lifecycle points — fully Codex-hook compatible, so existing hook scripts work as-is. |
| **L3** | Mini App | Generating dedicated interfaces, forms, panels, or visualizations for tasks. |
| **L4** | Source-level customization | Changing tools, adapters, UI, Runtime, or product shape. |

You can use BitFun's Code Agent to extend BitFun itself.
